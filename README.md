dev-test
========

Part of the turner dev challenge. 

In this application I have merged a nodejs chatting application along and added the functionality of finding movie details inside of it as well creating a richer chatting experience, specially if the people chatting are interested in movies and such.

Needs polishing, but the core features are there. Also, it's responsive, but to catter to mobile devices, at least functionality wise, some tweaks need be done (not major stuff). 

Instructions
========
Clone the repo, cd into it and run on the root directory:

# node chatserver.js

Then just go to your localhost:8080 and click on the connect button.
